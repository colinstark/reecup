# Reecup
## A multiplayer browser game inspired by Rummikub and Mahjonng.
This is a backend server for a rummicup game server, written in Go as a final project of the Boot.dev bootcamp.

## Why?
This was a learning project to explore websockets and Go.

## Future
- Build a real frontend
- Flesh out the tests to handle actual turns
- Maybe tap into Go concurrency.


## Quick Start
You'll need Go 1.16 or higher, and Bun/Node installed.

## ü§ù Contributing
This is a learning project, and I'm not looking for contributors right now..
